1) What is Mutable String in Java Explain with an example?

Ans:-The String class is immutable, which means that once a Stringobject is created, its value 
cannot be changed. However, there are otherclasses in Java, such as StringBuilder and 
StringBuffer, which aremutable and can be used to manipulate strings. 
Here's an example of using a mutable string in Java with the 
StringBuilder class: 
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello"); 
sb.append(" World"); // append method adds the string " World" to theend of sb 
System.out.println(sb); // prints "Hello World" 
In this example, we create a StringBuilder object sb with an initial valueof "Hello". We then use 
the append method to add the string " World" tothe end of sb. Finally, we print the value of sb, 
which is "Hello World".
